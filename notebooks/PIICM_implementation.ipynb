    "Will make a stab at implementing the original version of PIICM in the newest version of gpytorch. There are a few ingredients that are needed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The kernel  -- we need to construct a permutation invariant covariance function.\n",
    "    1. Needs to return objects with custom .matmul routines, custom log_det calculations etc. This was done in the original implementation by extending the `LazyTensor` class, which is no longer available. Will need to work with the `LinearOperators` instead, but hopefully should be rather straight-forward.\n",
    "2. The likelihood -- we need a multi-task normal likelihood that allows us to add a observation specific noise term\n",
    "3. Model -- putting these two together and maximizing the marginal likelihood using CG for the inverse solve and a custom log-determinant calculation involving Weyl's inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It needs to all play nice with the current classes, extending were needed but otherwise not interferring with gpytorch."
